# learning-project
Informal learning project for working with web5 utilities

# Aim
Change the prototype into a notetaking application that reads and writes to a dwn.
Accept a list of entries (book titles, list of classes) via VC and/or granting access to someone else.
Import a list of book titles from a separate personal book list which uses https://schema.org/Book 

# How to use the prototype
Change the settings on your computer to prompt you when saving a file. 
Download the files within the prototype folder.

1. From the index page click on "Add a New Entry." Then click the Choose file button and upload the entries.json file. 
Add an entry by filling in the title and using the dropdown to choose the sourcetype (preset as Publication, Study and General). 
Click on the Create new entry button and save by overwriting the entries.json file. Go back to the index page.

2. Click on "Add a new note to an existing entry" and upload the entries.json file. Pick the entry you made, or any others. 
The name and any existing notes will show. In the last textbox add a new entry and click the Save new note button to overwrite the
entries.json file again. Go back to the index page.
3. Click on "Review notes and create a draft essay or report" and upload entries.json. Use the drop down lists to choose each entry and 
the corresponding notes. Click on the Add note to draft button to add your choice of note to the page. Do this a few times with different
notes and then click on the Save draft button to save a file called draft.txt (or anything you like). This will show all the choices as a 
basis for an essay or report.
